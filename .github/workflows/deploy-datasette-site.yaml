# In addition to his (easy to follow) post, I had to:
# - [set permissions so `allUsers` had `Cloud Run Invoker` role](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/managing-access#making_a_service_public)
# - [map custom domain using Cloud Run domain mapping](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/mapping-custom-domains#run) (my domain was already verified; had to add a CNAME in my DNS)
